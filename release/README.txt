PostalBorkenMenu V2A42
POSTAL: Brain-Damaged

BASE
Built from V2A41 while preserving the V2A40 stable-window subclass fix that the user validated.

THIS BUILD
V2A42 reconstructs the desired five-tab overlay and cleans the named weapon lists.

TABS
- Gameplay
- Weapons
- Arsenal
- Special
- Visual

ARSENAL
Only single WeaponId variants are exposed.

Base:
- Shovel
- Pistol
- Shotgun
- Machine Gun
- Rocket Launcher
- Lightning Gun
- Gatling Gun
- Dildo Bow
- Cat Canon

These Sunny Daze / PTSD:
- Um Drill
- Piss Gun
- Meat Shotgun
- Bubble Gum Machine Gun
- Nuclear Syringe

All _Akimbo WeaponIds are intentionally removed from the overlay.

SPECIAL
Kept:
- Hook (Add Only)
- Cutscene Weapon DLC
- No Weapon
- No Weapon DLC

Removed:
- Dong
- Dong Confusion
- Dong Fire
- Dong Ice

The Hook path remains AddWeapon-only and is never passed through EquipWeapon.

SKIP INTRO VIDEOS
A new checkbox appears in the Gameplay tab.

Default:
SkipIntroVideos=1

The value is persisted in PostalBorkenMenu.ini under [Settings].
Changing the checkbox affects the next launch.

Implementation for this test:
- no game files are renamed or deleted
- SAVE_DATA.cfg is not modified
- no EXE/GameAssembly patching
- while V2A40 qualifies the foreground game HWND, after the same HWND has remained valid for 1 second, the ASI sends exactly one synthetic Escape key pulse if Skip Intro Videos is enabled
- the normal V2A40 WndProc subclass is still delayed until 3 seconds of HWND stability
- no repeated key injection occurs

This deliberately targets startup only and does not touch normal in-game cutscenes.

STABILITY PRESERVED
- V2A40: 3-second stable foreground HWND qualification before SetWindowLongPtrW
- V2A8: early WM_CLOSE shutdown fencing
- no permanent IL2CPP crosshair polling
- V2A29 weapon-wheel behavior
- exact-name WeaponId resolver remains targeted
- no broad Assembly-CSharp scans
- no startup Hook recovery

TEST
1. Launch normally with SkipIntroVideos=1.
2. Confirm whether the intro video is skipped.
3. Confirm the game reaches the menu and remains stable.
4. Open F1.
5. Check all five tabs.
6. Confirm Arsenal contains no Akimbo entries.
7. Confirm Special contains no Dong entries.
8. Toggle Skip Intro Videos off and on once to verify checkbox persistence.
9. Test one normal Arsenal weapon and, if owned, one DLC weapon.
10. Exit normally and send PostalBorkenMenu.log.
